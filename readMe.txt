First of all, run the python file to generate features 'csv' files for both the dataset. 
Then, go into the cuda_elm folder and run both cuda files in order to get the output provided in the screenshot folders.
I tried it with 3 runs and get average accuracy which i provided in report. 
Thank you.


Warning: 
Output might be differ in your PC. bcz CUDA-ELM uses random weights every time. So, accuracy is depend on weights.
